Machine Learning Models for Well Log Analysis

# Internship Project at ONGC

## Developed Machine Learning Models for Well Log Analysis

### Project Description

- **Predictive Model**: Created a model to estimate log curves, such as density porosity, by leveraging relationships with other manually obtainable logs.
- **Classification Model**: Developed a model to analyze oil well logs and categorize them into specific lithology types at various depths.

### Tools/Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Data Analysis
